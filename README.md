## RL
The aim of the project is to make a toy implementation of the main concepts of RL as a learning exercise.

The overall structure being aimed for is a central core which will handle the basic structure of RL tasks and provide general algorithms and datastructures and a series of packages built off the core to implement well known example problems in the field (e.g. Bandits, GridWorld etc)
